# Textful
Textful represents a sophisticated web-based platform that empowers users to exchange text messages individually or within groups they create.

In the realm of chat applications, the conventional approach leans heavily on the utilization of web sockets within browsers to facilitate internet-based communication. To address this, our innovation at Textful involves crafting a robust solution that strategically leverages web APIs. This strategic pivot significantly reduces the application's reliance on web sockets, ensuring a more efficient and reliable mode of communication for our users.
